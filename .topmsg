Subject: [PATCH] experimental/multiple-versions-in-one-file

purpose:
  PHP: fpm support (including patches for systemd socket activation)
  nixos systemd unit implementation
  keep old PHP-5.2 working even though its horrible outdated.

keep everything in one file, because most code is the same, eg the code to build
extensions (apc, xdebug, ..)
