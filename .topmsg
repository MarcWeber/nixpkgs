Subject: [PATCH] experimental/multiple-versions-in-one-file

php nixpkgs:
  PHP: fpm support (including patches for systemd socket activation)
  nixos systemd unit implementation

  make PHP know about /var/setuid-wrappers/sendmail (path is configurable)

  keep everything in one file, because most code is the same, eg the code to
  build extensions (apc, xdebug, ..)

  There have been quite a lot of changes in nixpkgs master. I think I merged
  all changes.

  keep supporting PHP 5.3 because PHP 5.3 and 5.4 are not compatible always
  I know I should upgrade ...

nixos:
  provide php-fpm module which figures out how many php-fpm daemoens to use
  automatically. Its still your task to to configure apache/ nginx.
  You do so by using a function returning the socket path based on
  your configuration.
  nixos/modules/services/misc/phpfpm.nix contains a usage example.

  Enabling xdebug is very easy now, see example at
  nixos/modules/services/misc/phpfpm.nix

  Same to enabling opcache.

  replace nixos/modules/services/web-servers/phpfpm.nix
  by nixos/modules/services/misc/phpfpm.nix
  because its more powerful

Till this gets merged you can follow the topic branch experimental/php at
github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs.
