Subject: [PATCH] marc-nixos/minimal-install-archive

experimental/minimal-install-archive

keep my minmial boot archive working. Its a simple archive which is self contained
and does
- chroot
- ship glibc, nix, .. so that you can install nixos

TODO: think about difference to what Eelco contributed recently, patch with comment:

  Scripts to set up and run the absolute minimal pure Nix
  environment; that is, an operating system environment in which there
  is (essentially) only a store.

Problems: passwd is not empty. You have to boot once, reboot into rescue and
set passowrd (TODO !!)
