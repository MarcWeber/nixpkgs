Subject: [PATCH] experimental/vim-plugins-extra-file

Refactoring vim plugins again:
- sort automatcially generated vim derivations
- move the plugins to be derived by VAM into its own file: vim-plugin-names
- rename vimrc into vimUtils moving all common code into it
  so that it is possible to use it within ~/.nixpkgs/config.nix
- Moving all important documentation into vimUtils
- provide vimPlugins.pluginnames2Nix to provide a bin/vim-* command
  writing updated derivations into its buffer

VAM's repository's nix.vim got some improvements @ VAM repository, eg hg
fetchout out got fixed and shell failures are noticed now (Thanks to Arseniy
Seroka)
