Subject: [PATCH] experimental/nixos-module-resource-tracking

Adding a nixos module resource-tracking.nix which is used to track which
modules require what resources. A resource could be anything which should be
prevented from being used multiple times such as
  - paths
  - sockets
  - memory
  - ports
  - mysql instance ids
  ..
