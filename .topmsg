Subject: [PATCH] experimental/cups-1.6-and-1.7

The new cupsd-1.7.nix adds services.cupsd_1_7.

Both modules cupsd-1.7.nix and cupsd.nix have a new option "cupsPackages" which
is the way to specifiy which cups/ghostscript versions to use.

1.6.4+ comes with some changes:
- default filter chain is PDF, gs is only used for gs printers
- some stuff has been moved into cupsFilters and is maintained by
  openprinting now
- cups has 2 configuration files now
- some more less important changes such as compressing print files sent over
  the network and whatnot (I didn't test them)

Issues:
- printing test pages does not work yet

fixes:
- printing on older canon bjc 4000 or MP980 printer using gutentprint drivers
  works. 1.5.4 only prints 30% of page for whatever reason.

new packages: ijs, qpdf
ghostscript: get back the update which got reverted while keeping the old version

This includes b96fc98306a pull/1115
