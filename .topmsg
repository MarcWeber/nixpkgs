Subject: [PATCH] experimental/multiple-versions-in-one-file

php nixpkgs:
  PHP: fpm support (including patches for systemd socket activation)
  nixos systemd unit implementation
  keep old PHP-5.2 working even though its horrible outdated.

  make PHP know about /var/setuid-wrappers/sendmail (path is configurable)

  keep everything in one file, because most code is the same, eg the code to
  build extensions (apc, xdebug, ..)

  Well - yes - there have been quite a lot of changes in nixpkgs master.
  I tried to keep my branch up to date.

nixos:
  provide php-fpm module which figures out how many php-fpm daemoens to use
  automatically. Its still your task to to configure apache/ nginx.
  You do so by using a function returning the socket path based on
  your configuration.
  nixos/modules/services/misc/phpfpm.nix contains a usage example.

  Enabling xdebug is very easy now.

Till this gets merged you can follow the topic branch experimental/php at
github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs.
