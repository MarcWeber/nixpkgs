Subject: [PATCH] experimental/multiple-versions-in-one-file

This patch introduces mergeAttrsByVersion to lib.

In some cases it does make sense to keep "experimental" and "older" versions of
the same package in one file because it follows the "do it once" principle only.
Very often many versions share their build instructions.

I agree with Eelco that if tweaks for individual versions become too much they
shoud be split into individual files.
