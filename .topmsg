Subject: [PATCH] experimental/gutenprint

gutenprint updates

- add option to build cvs version

- drop composable derivation which is overkill in this simple case

TODO: Check wether this patch can be simplified, eg are openjade patches still
neccessary or whether there is a more current upstream and such
