    nix2/nixos-eval-config-rewrite
    
    While the nixos configuration system gets its job done it has some flaws:
    - much code hard to read
    - mkElse has very wired behaviour (see bug tracker)
    - I couldn't maintain it and always wondered how to setup option declarations
      such as  jobs (.*.) myself - and failed several times
    
    That's why I felt its was time to rewrite the nixos configuration system
    trying to keep the code base as small as possible.
    
    Basic setup is working. Missing:
      - overrides (easy to add)
      - .*. and many option type implementations.
      - think about mkOption
