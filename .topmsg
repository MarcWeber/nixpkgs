marc-nixos/postfix
    
- use null instead of "" for some options which means don't set option at all
  to make it clearer that the option is unset rather than set to "" which means
  postfix defaults apply
- use default configuration /etc/postfix/main.cf So that sendmail and postfix
  flush just works and postconf prints correct configuration location and that
  its no longer necessary to pass configuration location
- remove all the impure ln stuff creating untracked files in the conf directory.
  Instead create .db files in store
  (TOOD: !take care about passwords!)
- replace options extraAliases, postmaster etc by assertions forcing you to
  think about creating alias table
- assemble command dir adding links to sgid wrapped applications correctly

TODO: merge with upstream changes
