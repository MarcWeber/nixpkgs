Subject: [PATCH] tmp/gtk3

gtk3 related updates:
pygtk is now contained in pygobject
gobjectIntrospection now creates interface files:
- typelib files
- gir files
typelib files are compressed gir files
Eventually multiple derivation outputs should be used, because uncompressed gir
xml files are huge (30% of the final gobject gtk derivation for instance)

this makes it possible to compile:
- gnome color manager (colord)
- dispcalgui
- mypaint (git version)
